/// Sound data that can be played back.
///
/// All of the playback methods on this type return a [`SoundInstance`] that
/// can be used to control the sound after it has started. If you just want
/// to 'fire and forget' a sound, you can discard it - the sound will
/// continue playing regardless.
///
/// # Supported Formats
///
/// Various file formats are supported, and can be enabled or disabled via Cargo features:
///
/// | Format | Cargo feature | Enabled by default? |
/// |-|-|-|
/// | WAV | `audio_wav` | Yes |
/// | OGG Vorbis | `audio_vorbis | Yes |
/// | FLAC | `audio_flac` | Yes |
/// | MP3 | `audio_mp3` | Yes |
///
/// # Performance
///
/// Creating a `Sound` is a fairly cheap operation, as the data is not decoded until playback begins.
///
/// Cloning a `Sound` is a very cheap operation, as the underlying data is shared between the
/// original instance and the clone via [reference-counting](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/rc/struct.Rc.html).
///
/// # Examples
///
/// The [`audio`](https://github.com/17cupsofcoffee/tetra/blob/main/examples/audio.rs)
/// example demonstrates how to play several different kinds of sound.
#[derive(Debug, Clone)] // TODO: This used to impl PartialEq, do we still want that?
